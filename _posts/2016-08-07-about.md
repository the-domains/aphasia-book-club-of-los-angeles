The purpose of our book club is create an opportunity for persons with aphasia to read and discuss adult fiction and non-fiction books. Depending on reading ability, our members read books, listen to audiobook versions, or both. 

We have two book club chapters. One chapter held at the [Echo Park branch library][0] every Thursday from 1:30 - 3:30 pm and another chapter held at the [Mid-Valley branch library][1] (Northridge) every Monday from 1:00 - 3:00 pm.
